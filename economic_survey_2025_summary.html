            <div class="section">
                <h3>Philosophy of Policy Makers</h3>
                <p>The core philosophy centers on leveraging India's demographic dividend by creating quality jobs and fostering inclusive, sustainable economic growth.  This involves aligning the workforce with global demands through reskilling, upskilling, and new-skilling initiatives, while also simplifying compliance and promoting labor flexibility to encourage job creation.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Previous Performance Summary</h3>
                <p>India experienced substantial employment growth post-pandemic. Unemployment rates declined significantly, and labor force participation and worker population ratios increased.  However, the agriculture sector remains dominant, with a rise in self-employment and a shift in women's participation towards self-employment and household enterprises.  While factory employment showed resilience, wage growth lagged behind corporate profit growth, raising concerns about income inequality.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Future Predictions</h3>
                <p>India is projected to become the third-largest economy by 2030, requiring the creation of millions of non-farm jobs annually.  The digital economy and renewable energy sectors are identified as key drivers of high-quality job creation.  Continued growth hinges on addressing skill gaps, improving wage distribution, and fostering women's participation in the workforce.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Key Policy Changes and Reforms</h3>
                <p>Significant policy changes include the four new Labour Codes aimed at simplifying regulations, increasing labor flexibility, and strengthening worker welfare.  Initiatives to promote women's entrepreneurship, skill development programs (PMKVY, JSS, PM Vishwakarma), and the eShram portal for unorganized workers are also highlighted.  A new package of five schemes focusing on employment and skilling for 4.1 crore youth over five years was announced.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Growth Drivers and Challenges</h3>
                <p>Growth drivers include a young population, increased formalization, government initiatives promoting entrepreneurship and skill development, and the growth of the digital and renewable energy sectors.  Challenges include addressing skill gaps, income inequality (particularly the widening gap between corporate profits and wage growth), and systemic barriers hindering women's workforce participation.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Global Impact and Comparisons</h3>

            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Conclusion and Actionable Insights</h3>
                <p>India's employment growth shows promise, but sustained success requires addressing skill gaps, promoting gender equality, and ensuring fair income distribution.  Further reforms are needed to streamline regulations, enhance worker safety, and foster collaboration between industry, academia, and government to fully realize the potential of the demographic dividend.  The PM Internship Scheme is a significant step towards bridging the gap between education and employment.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Philosophy of Policy Makers</h3>
                <p>The core philosophy is to achieve 'Viksit Bharat' (developed India) by 2047 through sustained 8% annual GDP growth. This requires a significant increase in investment and focuses on unleashing domestic growth levers, primarily by enhancing economic freedom for individuals and businesses through deregulation.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Previous Performance Summary</h3>
                <p>India has implemented significant structural reforms in the last decade, including GST, IBC, and the India Stack.  While these reforms yielded positive externalities, challenges remain, particularly concerning regulatory burdens hindering MSME growth and employment.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Future Predictions</h3>
                <p>The IMF projects India to become a $5 trillion economy by FY28 and $6.3 trillion by FY30, with nominal GDP growth around 10.2% in USD terms.  However, the report acknowledges the uncertain global environment marked by geo-economic fragmentation and China's growing dominance in manufacturing and energy transition.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">

            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Key Policy Changes and Reforms</h3>
                <p>Key policy changes involve systematic deregulation to reduce compliance burdens for MSMEs, simplifying taxation and labor regulations, decriminalizing business laws (Jan Vishwas Act), and promoting digitalization.  States are encouraged to adopt a three-step process for deregulation: identifying areas, comparing regulations, and estimating costs.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Growth Drivers and Challenges</h3>
                <p>Growth drivers include domestic investment, increased efficiency, and deregulation.  Challenges include geo-economic fragmentation, China's dominance in global supply chains, and the need to balance environmental goals with economic growth.  Over-regulation, particularly impacting MSMEs, is a significant hurdle.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Global Impact and Comparisons</h3>
                <p>India's economic trends are analyzed within the context of global geo-economic fragmentation and China's rising economic power. The report compares India's regulatory environment with other countries, highlighting opportunities for learning and reform.  The report emphasizes the need for a more inward-looking approach to growth, given global uncertainties.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Opportunities for Businesses and Investors</h3>
                <p>Opportunities exist in domestic supply chains for renewable energy, EVs, and other sectors.  Deregulation will create a more favorable investment climate, particularly for MSMEs.  The report highlights the potential for growth in India's Mittelstand, mirroring the success of similar sectors in other countries.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Technology and Innovation Impact</h3>
                <p>Digital transformation (India Stack) is highlighted as a success.  The report emphasizes the need for investment in emerging technologies like AI, robotics, and biotechnology to drive future growth.  However, the focus is primarily on creating a regulatory environment conducive to innovation, rather than specific technological advancements.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                <p>Deregulation aims to boost employment, particularly in the MSME sector.  The report acknowledges the need to address the education-employment gap and improve the quality of education.  However, a detailed analysis of the social impact of deregulation is not provided.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Conclusion and Actionable Insights</h3>
                <p>The report concludes that systematic deregulation is crucial for achieving India's growth targets.  It recommends a three-step process for states to undertake deregulation, focusing on reducing compliance costs, improving enforcement transparency, and adopting risk-based regulation.  The report emphasizes the importance of learning from other states and countries' experiences and adopting a 'minimum necessary, maximum feasible' approach to regulation.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Philosophy of Policy Makers</h3>
                <p>The core philosophy emphasizes resilience and proactive adaptation to global uncertainties.  The strategic intent is to enhance India's competitiveness in global trade, attract FDI, and foster sustainable economic growth through deregulation and ease of doing business initiatives.  A calibrated approach to industrial policy, using tariffs strategically alongside other tools, is advocated.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Previous Performance Summary</h3>
                <p>India's external sector showed resilience despite global headwinds.  Exports (merchandise and services) reached USD 602.6 billion (6% YoY growth), with strong performance in services and non-petroleum goods.  Imports grew by 6.9%, reflecting robust domestic demand.  FPI flows were mixed, while gross FDI inflows revived but net FDI declined due to increased repatriation. Foreign exchange reserves remained strong, covering 90% of external debt.</p>
